:summary: All about Nimrod.
:slug: about-me

Hi.
I'm Nimrod Adar, a Linux and BSD sysadmin and as-needed developer from Haifa, Israel.

This is my blog about what I do and thus it serves 2 purposes. The 1st is to be my personal journal to document the how or why of some problem solving. The 2nd is more outward facing, for it be a resource for others (by no way complete) and for me to publish whenever I need to.

Also, I'm a part-time freelancer so you can contact me at `nimrod@shore.co.il <mailto: nimrod@shore.co.il>`_ or at 052-8713696 (+972-52-871-3696 outside of Israel).

Last thing, my public `GPG public key <https://www.shore.co.il/blog/static/nimrod.gpg>`_
